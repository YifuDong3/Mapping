Food Establishment Inspection(Megha, Sky, Xuan, Yifu)

Additional Note:
There is something wrong with our Map4. When we ran the chunk alone, it worked pretty well and showed the map as expectation. However, when we knit the rmd file, the output was not what we want, which shows no classifications of radius and colors. It's pretty weird and we haven't found related solution in Google. I think it might be due to the limitation of "addCircleMarkers()" when transfering the code into rmd output.

Below is the right plot we get from the code alone:
